I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.



### Research interests

Methodologically, my research interests include Bayesian inference, graphical models, spatio-temporal models, non-parametric methods (and intersections thereof) and environmental & ecological statistics.


### Research Projects

1. *MSc thesis*: Bayesian methods for the analysis of functional data. (University of Cape Town)
Currently, I am working on the development of Bayesian historical functional linear models to forecast atmospheric pollutants using daily meteorological processes. [(github.com/yovnajunglee/BayesHFLM)](https://github.com/yovnajunglee/BayesHFLM)


2. *Honours thesis*: Spatial Occupancy Models - Reducing run-times. (University of Cape Town)
We developed scalable spatial occupancy models using consensus Monte Carlo. The objective was to make these models more efficient and practical for large data sets which arise from analysing multi-species data and/or large conservation efforts. 

### Awards

+ South African Statistical Association (SASA) Best Postgraduate Paper Award (First Prize, 2021) for *'Bayesian Analysis of Historical Functional Linear Models with application to air pollution forecasting'*. 


### Software

+ (Under development) [BayesHFLM](https://github.com/yovnajunglee/BayesHFLM) - An R package for the Bayesian Analysis of Historical Functional Linear Models.
