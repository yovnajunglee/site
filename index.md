### Biography

I am an MSc student in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the Univerity of Cape Town. My research interests lie in the development data-driven methodologies to solve challenges in the biomedical, ecological and environmental sciences. 


#### Research interests

Methodologically, my research interests include Bayesian inference, graphical models and non-parametric methods (and intersections thereof). 


#### Research Projects

1. *MSc thesis*: Bayesian methods for the analysis of functional data. (Ongoing)
Currently, I am working on the development of Bayesian historical functional linear models (yovnajunglee/BayesHFLM) to forecast atmospheric pollutants using daily meteorological processes.

2. *Honours thesis*: Spatial Occupancy Models - Reducing run-times.
We developed scalable spatial occupancy models using consensus Monte Carlo. The objective was to make this models more efficient and practical for large data sets which arise from analysing multi-species data and/or large conservation efforts. 

#### Teaching experience
