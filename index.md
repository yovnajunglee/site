I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto.



### Research interests

Methodologically, my research interests include Bayesian inference, graphical models, spatio-temporal models, non-parametric methods (and intersections thereof) and environmental & ecological statistics.


### Education

+ *PhD Statistics. University of Toronto. 2022-Present.*


+ *MSc Advanced Analytics. University of Cape Town. 2020-2022.*

Thesis: Developed Bayesian historical functional linear models which account for measurement error in the predictor processes to forecast atmospheric pollutants using daily meteorological processes. [(github.com/yovnajunglee/BayesHFLM)](https://github.com/yovnajunglee/BayesHFLM)


+ *BBusSci Analytics (Mathematical Statistics). University of Cape Town. 2016-2019.*

Research project: Developed scalable spatial occupancy models using consensus Monte Carlo. The objective was to make these models more efficient and practical for large data sets which arise from analysing multi-species data and/or large conservation efforts. 

### Awards

+ South African Statistical Association (SASA) Best Postgraduate Paper Award (First Prize, 2021) for *'Bayesian Analysis of Historical Functional Linear Models with application to air pollution forecasting'*. 


### Software

+ (Under development) [BayesHFLM](https://github.com/yovnajunglee/BayesHFLM) - An R package for the Bayesian Analysis of Historical Functional Linear Models.
